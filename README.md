input.conf contains keybinds which have to be placed in there for some scripts to work.

script-opts contains config files for scripts where applicable.

Not all these scripts are completely ready, for example seamlessloop only works when hwdec is either off or when coopyback is enabled (hwdec=auto-copy). I am working on updating them.
